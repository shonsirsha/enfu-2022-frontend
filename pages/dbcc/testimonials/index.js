		First, the main attraction of the DBCC is the very interesting case, so not only follow the BCC, but learn during each series of competitions. Secondly, we are also given various challenges outside of the cases we have to work on, such as having a pre-event to practice our case-solving abilities, and in the final we also have to work on a minicase that is no less exciting. Finally, of course, theprizes are very interesting to get!

Our team was having a great experience where we share different thoughts each other who are from different fields. Many new things I knew even though our team couldnâ€™t step to a further stage of this competition. One thing different between DBCC and other business case competition was DBCC provided participants experienced speakers coaching how to solve the case. Hopefully DBCC always continue every year.`}
